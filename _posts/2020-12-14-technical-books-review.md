[xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code](https://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Code/dp/0131495054)

I'm interested in following answers though the book offers more:

* What's the Goal of Unit Testing?
* Should we prepare test data as a whole on the SUT or should we create them dynamically for each test? - The Philosophy and Priciples in Unit Testing
* What kinds of tests should be automated? - Strategic (expensive-to-change) decision in Testing
* How xUnit works? - The characteristics of an xUnit system
* How to gradually adopt automated test?
* When should I use record/playback method?
* How to implement a method using xUnit?
