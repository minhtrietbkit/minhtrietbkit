Following summary is from [The Five Elements Of Effective Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/5-Elements-Effective-Thinking/dp/0691156662). Some parts are copied verbatim.

# Ground - Understand Simple Things Deeply

### Actions:

   1. Revisit the fundamentals to gain deeper understandings of the subject.
   6. Accurately and honestly describe what I see/know and what I don't forces me to identify and fill gaps in my understanding and may lead to new ideas.
   4. Find the easier sub problem and solve it
   > If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can’t solve: find it. George Polya
   5. Find evidences for statements.
   4. Remember my understandings are influenced by "authority", "repetition" and "my own bias/prejudice".

### Habits:

**Master The Basics**
* Consider an area to improve
* Spend 5 mins listing out its specific components
* Spend 30 mins improving one of them

**Confirm You Understand The Basics**
* Consider an area to improve you think you know or a subject you are trying to master. Open up a blank document on your computer. 
* Write a corehent, accurate and comprehensive outline along with examples of its fundamentals. This process should be effortless.
* Compare your work with external source.

**Find and Solve The Smaller Problem**
* Consider a problem.
* Find one sub problem and solve it.
* Understand its connections and implications; consider it from many point of views.

**Find The Gaps**
* Consider an area.
* Write down the weaknesses and strengths of what I know.
* Attach adjectives or descriptive phrases to more accurately describe what I "see".
* Deliberately avoid glossing over any vagueness.
* Assert what is tepid or missing in my understanding.
* Fill in the gaps.
* Consider whether the adjs and phrases suggest new possibilities

Example: Before we had colorized photos, people just call it photos. If someone unnecessarily added "black-and-white", it would lead to an idea of "colorized" photos.

**Reduce Bias**
* Consider several views of a problem.
* Alternately support each of them in 15-min intervals and list out its implications.


# Fire - Igniting Insights Through Mistakes

> Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm. ~ Winston Churchill

### Actions:

* When I fail, isolate specific failed features of that attempt.
* Deliberately do it wrong to identify and clarify specifically where defects lie.
* Ask myself if this wrong solution is correct for another question.
* Generate useful mistakes by simply tackling the issue by quickly constructing a solution with little or no effort.
* Exaggerate situations to reveal creative solutions or show what a possible defect of a supossedly perfect answer.

### Habits:

**How To Start Doing Something Mundane**

* Just write whatever right/wrong/vague ideas down.
* Highlight the rights: uncover what deeply resounds with me, suggestive words or unstated interesting notions.
* Exploit the wrongs: find the root cause and fix it.

**Bad Days Give Good Exp**
* When I have a bad day, set time to review it.

**Exaggerate To Find Faults and Creative Solutions**

*To find faults*

* Consider a solution.
* Exaggerate it.
* Find faults.
* Confirm whether they exist in the original nonexaggerated perspective.

*To find creative solutions*

* Consider a problem.
* Exaggerate it.
* Find the solution to it.
* See how a (possibly over-the-top) solution to an exaggerated problem can guide solution to the non-exaggerated problem.

# Air - Questioning 

### Action:
* Ask what is missing/assumed/vague or might be extended.

### Habits:

**Teach To Learn**

* Consider an area.
* Create list of fundamental questions and answers that will guide to a complete explanation including motivation, examples, overview and details.
* Prepare a min lecture.
* Deliver the lecture to others.
* Ask the audience questions to measure how well I understand and articulate my message.

# Water - Flow 

### Actions:
* See a matter in a flow, not in isolation:
  * Understand current ideas by understanding more basic elements that lead to current issue and the connection.
  * Generate new ideas through flow by first modifying an existing idea within its own context and then apply that same idea in different settings. Then construct extensions, refinements and variations.
* Imagine what comes next to better understand the current idea.
* Look back at earlier, easier material to see what brought me here reinforce understanding of previous knowledge and current issue.
* When learning a new concept, think about its extensions, variations, and applications.
* Starting with what is currently the best is often the ideal place to expect great improvements.

### Habits:

**Thinking Back**
* Consider the current area/problem
* Ask how the issue at hand landed in front of me.
* Ask where and what it was yesterday, a month ago, a year ago and so forth.

**Take Up Out-Dated Perspective To Generate Creative Question In The Now Or Future**

* Consider a current trend/belief.
* Find one with common nature in the past which is now abolished.
* Ask why that belief was abandoned. 
* Ask if the same may happen to the current trend.

Example: it used to be fine to joke about ethnics; now that won't be tolerant. However, we are still perfectly fine with classifying students on grades. Perhaps this too will be gone in the future.


# Quintessential Element - Change

### Action:

* Consider the possibility that to better do something, it's necessary to do a subtle but different task.
* > Definition of insanity: Doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome ~ The Five Elements Of Thinking
* > Life is a work-in-progress. (So don't be depressed when I'm a mess and embrace change.) ~ Me

### Habits:

**Improve A Skill**:

* Consider a skill.
* Imagine in detail what a more skilled practitioner does or what added knowledge, understanding, and previous experience the expert would bring to the task.
* Or think in terms of what kind of knowledge or skill or strategy would make my task an easier one.
* Compare those with what you're doing and see the difference.

# Personal Thought Of The Book

1. A rather nice model to reason about the process of thinking. 
2. Many overlappings and vague suggestions.
3. There are several good practical recommendations to become more creative.
4. Again, like many other self-help books, emphasize that we look at the world through a heavily biased len.
5. The writing style is pretty much like Stephen of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - quoting authors' experiences with practitioners or authors' own personal experience. I don't mind this kind of writing. I don't find it interesting however.
