Following summary is extracted from Chapter 1, 2 and 3 [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU).

# How to Build a New Habit

1. Clearly define the cue - what triggers the habit loop.
1. Clearly define the routine - what actions are in the habit.
1. Clearly defines the reward - what good thing happens if the habit happens.
1. Make sure the reward is something you crave for.

Example:

_Pepsodent habit loop:_

1. Cue is a film layer people could feel if they run their tongue through their teeth.
1. Routine is to brush teeth using Pepsodent.
1. Reward is tingling sensation in your mouth.

# How to Change an Old Habit

1. Figure out what the cue (really) is.
2. Figure out what the reward (really) is.
3. Keep the cue and the reward, change the routine.
4. Find a partner/community to create a belief that change is feasible.

Example:

_Snacking habit change:_

1. Cue is boredom.
2. Reward is little distraction from work.
3. Keep the same cue and reward, change routine from snacking to making & drinking blends (water won't work because the act of pouring a glass of water and drinking it happens too fast and therefore not long enough for a distraction)
4. Find someone to build the same habit, invite them to make a blend with you when your cue kicks in.
