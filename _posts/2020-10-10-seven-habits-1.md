Following summary is extracted from Chapter 1 of [The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519).

# Personality Ethic vs Charactier Ethic

There are two paradigms defining how `Success` is achieved:

- `Personality Ethic`: successful **technique**s that effect behavior and attitude such as communication skills, positive thinking... lead to success. It is what we say/do.
- `Character Ethic`: only by following in intergrate these basic **Principle**s into our charactor do we attain effective/successful living. It is who we are. There are principles of human society which are objective truths. What we think "the truth" is doesn't matter to its existence. And that the more our "truth" aligns with these principles, the more happiness we will attain in life.

To solve a problem, most people rely on personality ethic because it offers a quick fix that often works. However, in the long run, such techniques won't hold if the character ethic is not there.

A good example from the book:

If we want to visit a place and are given a map. If the map is wrong, no matter how hard you try (behavior) or how much positive thinking you put up (attitude) could get you to the right place. The wrong map is the problem and no behavior or attitude can change the result - that you'll end up in the wrong place. The map is like principle. The more our map (our principles) align with the true principles of the human society, the more successful/effective we will become.

# Personal Thought

1. This sounds a lot like [You Are What You Believe](https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-What-Believe-Transform/dp/1626566666) in that it points out our behavior/attitude towards life is based on our experience - our own len through which we perceive/interpret/understand life. And often times, we do not aware such a len exists and that it is governing our actions. Additionally, other people have their own lens.
2. The book encourages changes from the inside-out; do not cut corners but try to understand the problem in a deeper, higher level... Really, doesn't sound new to me. I'm expecting how Stephen clarify what he means by this in later chapters.
3. Though I have never finished "How to Win Friends and Influence People", it's funny how this introduction seems like an anti-thesis to the ever famous book by Dale Carnegie. I think some lessons in the "How to" book are what Stephen refers to as **techniques** - so-called "Band-Aids" that only provides short-term solution.
4. Favorite quote:
