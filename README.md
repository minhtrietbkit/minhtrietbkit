## How to use

Hi me in the future! You're reading this probably because you have been busy ~watching anime~ working all this time and therefore completely forgot the normal workflow to update this site.

Here's the quick recap:

1. Create new topic: add that in new topic `/_data/subpage.yml`
1. Add new reference: add that in `/_data/ref.yml`
1. Add new entry: 
    1. Make a copy of a post in `/_posts/`
    1. Rename it to the current date
    1. Change the content

## Commands

```Bash
bundle install #Install new gems if you do specify new dependencies in /Gemfile
bundle exec jekyll serve #build and serve sites offline
```
