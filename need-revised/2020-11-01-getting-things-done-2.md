Following summary is extracted from Chapter 1 of [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280). 

# Dealing Effectively with Internal Commitments

* Most stress comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept.
* Any commitments, big or small, you've made with yourself is subconsciously tracked by yourself.
* These __incompletes__ or __open loops__ - anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is and is pulling your attention.
* Examples of these open loops: replacing a lightbulb.

## How to Deal with Open Loops

1. Identify and Capture them all in some way
2. Clarify what exactly they man to you
3. Make a decision about how to move on them

# Basic Requirements for Managing Commitments:

Basic activities necessary for good commitment management:

1. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind - a collection tool, that you go to regularly and sort through
2. Clarify exactly what your commitment is and decide what you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it
3. Once all actions are defined, keep reminders of them organized in a system you review regularly

# The Real Work of Knowledge Work:

> In knowledge work... the task is not given; it has to be determined. 'What are the expected results from this work?' is... the key question in making knowledge workers productive. And it is a question that demands risky decisions. There is usually no right answer; there are choices instead. And results have to be clearly specified, if productivity is to be achieved." ~ Peter Drucker

# Why Things Are on Your Mind:

The reason something is on your mind is that you want it to be different than it currently is, and yet:

* You haven't clarified exactly what the intended outcome is
* You haven't decided what the very next physical action step is
* You haven't put reminders of the outcome and the qction required in a system you trust
