## Defining purpose

How do we know if our purpose is specific enough?

> That's when we're experiencing the benefits of focused purpose: **motivation**, **clarity**, **decision-making criteria**, **alignment** and **creativity**
## Defining Principles

How do I define a project's principles?

> Fill in the gaps: I would give people totally free to do this as long as they [...]

Principles provides reference for good conducts within the team, conducts that help to achieve the project's goal. It helps you and your team know how to work with each other to ensure success.

## Defining vision

This is the what - the detail sound, look and feel of the outcome. How do we get there?

> We can start with answering "Wouldn't it be great if...?" Usually, the picture you're painting will be very different from current reality.

## Brainstorming

Principles in Brainstorming:

* Don't judge, challenge evaluate or criticize: evaluations might be premature
* Go for quantity, not quality: you don't know what a good idea is until you have it
* Put analysis and organization in the background: it's not the time for this yet

## Organizing

Organizing helps answering these questions:

1. What things need to happen to achieve final result?
2. In what order must they occur?
3. What is the most important element to ensure project's success?


Steps:

1. Identify the significant pieces
2. Sort by (one or more):
  * components
  * sequences
  * priorities
3. Detail to the required degree

## Defining what to do next

If previous steps are done well enough, it should be clear what we should do next. 

At any point, imagine we're free and we want to move on with this project, if we can't comfortably answer "What to do next?", it's indication we have more to flesh out in the previous steps.

Steps:

1. Defining next actions for all parts that can move parallelly:
  1. Answer: "Is there something anybody could be doing on this right now?"
2. Defining next actions for planning if needed

**NOTE** The people responsible for all next actions must be clarified


# Notes
* How much planning is enough?

  > As much as you need to get the project off your mind

* Project is not working out, where to look for issue?
  > If you need more clarity, shift your focus up the steps and down if you need more action.
